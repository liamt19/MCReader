And view the NBT data for individual chunks within region files:

You can also search for items in block entities (chests) and in regular entities (mobs). This can be done by selecting one or more chunks within a loaded region file, or by using the "search folder" button to search each chunk in every region file in the chosen folder:

For villager trades, you can see every trade offer that has been generated for every villager in the region or folder. The default is to only include Librarians and Smiths.

The enumeration tabs simply print out everything within their region file, which you can search through manually.
This is an example of an [RLCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/rlcraft) save:
